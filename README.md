# Advanced Operational Development Project 2025

**Author**: Rayane Ayoub AIT ALLAOUA.

**Context**: University project carried out as part of the HAU803I course â€” Bioinformatics Masters of the university of Montpellier
**Subject**: Development of a read mapping tool on a reference genome

---

## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to implement a tool that allows:

- Reading files in FASTA and FASTQ formats
- Cleaning and validating the read sequences
- Indexing a genome using k-mers
- Mapping reads to the reference genome, including reverse complement strand support
- Displaying or exporting alignment results

---

## Compilation

The project can be compiled with any C++17 compatible compiler.

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o main main.cpp *.cpp
```

A `Makefile` is also provided to automate the compilation:

```bash
make
```

---

## Usage

The program is used via the command line:

```bash
./main <genome.fasta> <reads_folder> <kmer_size>
```

- `<genome.fasta>`: the reference genome in FASTA format.
- `<reads_folder>`: path to the folder containing the reads files
- `<kmer_size>`: size of the k-mers used for indexing
